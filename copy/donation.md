We encourage Cisco Academies to follow the following path :

1. Once you have registered on this website, please be sure that the encoded information is complete and correct via My Profile
2. Please describe the equipment you are willing to donate and be sure this equipment is part of the eligible equipment list.
3. Test equipment : we encourage you to test this equipment with your students.  You can perform the following challenge lab that will insure that the equipment can be used for the vast majority of the protocols and techniques that are learnt within the CCNA curriculum. 
4. We will match the equipment you intend to donate with academies trying to get equipment.  You will be contacted by email and you will be in touch with the receiving academy.
5. If you can afford the cost of shipment, we encourage you to send the equipment yourself.  However, if you need assistance or funding, please contact us.
6. Pair with receiving academy and help them setup again the challenge lab.

If you would like to donate equipment without involving students, you could skip the above third step.
